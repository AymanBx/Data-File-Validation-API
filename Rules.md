## TODOs
* Plan on extracting the validation rules from the JSON file
* Fix the naming within the JSON file (switched name to parameter)
* Order the parameters within "column" based on the maxient doc?
* Consider empty pipes.
* Consider null pipes.
* Figure out what other formats might be.

## Rules of the JSON file:
* The data is in a list []
* The first item of the list describes the format of the data.
* The second item of the list lists the parameters that we're checking against.
